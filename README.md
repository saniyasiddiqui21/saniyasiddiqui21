My name is Saniya Siddiqui.
I'm interested in data science field.
I'm currently pursuing master's in data science and analytics.
After completing my undergrad in Computer Science, I worked as a Data Analyst for 3 years which helped me in gathering the skills in 
Python(numpy, pandas, sklearn, etc), SQL(MSSQL, MYSQL, etc), data visualization using PowerBI, Tableau, etc. 
I am a fast learner, I possess excellent problem-solving capabilities and I can manage a significant work load. 
I have an impressive track record of achievements. For example, in my previous role I received an 'Award of Excellence' and 'Employee of the month' twice. 
The type of person I am, I always act as a positive role model for the company, and I will make sure I take responsibility for my ongoing professional development.
